Programming language
=====================
A language which is used to communicate between user and computer is called programming language.

Programming language acts like a mediator or interface between user and computer.

Diagram: introduction2.1

Programming language divided into two types.

1)Low Level Language 

2)High Level Language 

1)Low Level Language 
---------------------
A language which is understand by a computer easily is called low level language.

A language which is computer dependent is called low level language.

ex:
	Machine Language 
	Assembly Language
	
Machine Language 
-----------------
It is a fundemantal language of a computer which is combination of 
0's and 1's.

It is also known as binary language.

Our computer may understands many languages but to understand machine language computer does not required any translator.

Advantages: 

> A program writtens in machine language consumes less memory.

> It does not required any translator.

> It is more efficient when compare to other languages.

Disadvantages:

> It is a burdun on a programmer to remember dozen's of binary code.

> Whenever error raised in our program then locating and handling that error 
  becomes difficult.

> Modifications can't be done easily.


Assembly Language
-----------------
The second generation language came into an existence is called assembly language.

Assembly language is a replacement of symbols and letters for mathematical programming code i.e opcode values.

It is also known as symbolic language.

Assembly language can't understand by a computer directly.We required translator.

We have three translators.

i)Assembler 

ii)Compiler 

iii)Interpreter 


i)Assembler 
----------
It is one of the translator which converts assemblic code to machine code.

Merits:

> If anywhere error raised in our program locating and handling that error 
  becomes easy.

> Modifications can be done easily.

Demerits:

> It is a mind trick to remember symbolic code.

> It requires translator.

> It is less efficient when compare to machine language.

Q)What is Debugging?

Bug is also known as Error.

The process of eliminating the bugs from the application is called debugging.


2)High level language
---------------------
A language which is understand by a user easily is called high level language.

A language which is user dependent is called high level language.

ex:
	C++, Java, .Net , Python , Perl and etc.

Computer will not understand high level language directly. We required translators.

compiler 
--------
	It will compile and execute our program at at time.

interpreter 
----------
	It will execute our program line by line procedure.

Adantages:

> It is easy to learn and easy to use because it is similar to english        language.

> Debugging can be done easily.

> Modifications can be done easily.

Disadvantages:

> It requires translator.

> A program writtens in high level language consumes huge amount of memory.

> It is not efficient when compare to low level language.



Types of IT companies 
======================

1) Service Based companies 
---------------------------
	Companies those who provides services to client/customer.
	ex:
		Cognizent, Capgemini, TCS and etc.


2) Product Based companies 
-----------------------
	Companies those who have their own products to sell in the market.
	ex:
		Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Amazon and etc.
