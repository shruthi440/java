Comments in Java
=================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in our regular programming.

Comments will not display in output because they won't compile by the compiler.

In java, we have two types of comments.

1)Single line comment 
-------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2)Multiple line comment
-------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

ex:
---
//class declaration 
class Test
{
	//main method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//variable declaration 
		int x=10;

		//output stmt
		System.out.println(x);
	}
}

	payment module
	report generation module 
	and etc.

Every project contains two domains.

1)Technical Domain 
------------------
	It describes which which technology we developed our project.
	ex:
		Java

2)Functional Domain
