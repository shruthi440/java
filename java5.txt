History of Java
===============
In 1990, Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controll by a remote like setup box.
That time project was called Stealth project and later it was renamed to Green project.

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project and they have met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with graphic system.James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop the project.But the problem what they have faced is , C and C++ languages are system dependent.

In 1991 , they have developed a programming language called an OAK. OAK means strength , itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany, France , USA and etc.

In 1995, they have renamed OAK to Java.Java is a Island of an Indonasia where first coffee of seed was produced and during the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's.Hence symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.
